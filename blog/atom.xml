          <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We are pleased to announce a new way to communicate with the Lagom community: <a href="https://discuss.lagomframework.com">discuss.lagomframework.com</a>.</p>
<p>It is a <a href="https://www.discourse.org/">Discourse</a> forum sponsored by <a href="https://www.lightbend.com/">Lightbend</a>, and co-hosted under the discuss.lightbend.com domain, along with discuss.playframework.com and discuss.akka.io. Each of these domains redirects you to the main category for the corresponding project, so you can go directly to the Lagom discussions by using the discuss.lagomframework.com shortcut, without having to navigate through the entire list of all categories. At the same time, discussions relating to the foundational technologies that Lagom is built on are right within reach on the same site. This will make it simpler for the Akka, Play, and Lagom communities to learn from each other and share ideas.</p>
<p>To further explain what&rsquo;s going to happen next to the other communication channels, and what their intended use is:</p>
<h2>What happens to the lagom-framework mailing list?</h2>
<p>The lagom-framework mailing list on Google Groups will be transitioned into a read-only mode. It will not happen immediately, but we&rsquo;ll try to direct all new questions to the new forum, and eventually flip the switch to mark lagom-framework as a read-only archive.</p>
<p>We took this decision after much thought, debate and considering the various up and down sides of handling it very seriously. We know that a mailing list work-flow is very precious for people used to working with them (plenty of us including), however in order to grow the community as a whole, and also help making the discussions on such forum more searchable and accessible, we decided that this move will be beneficial for everyone involved.</p>
<p>If you enjoy working with mailing lists, and would like to continue to do so with the new forums, please have a look at the <a href="https://discuss.lightbend.com/c/meta">hints in the Discuss Meta topics</a>, where we prepared hints on how to set up the <a href="https://discuss.lightbend.com/t/how-to-use-the-discuss-forum-as-a-mailing-list/61">notifications to work as-if a mailing list</a>.</p>
<h2><a href="#what-happens-to-the-gitter-channels-" name="what-happens-to-the-gitter-channels-">What happens to the Gitter channels?</a></h2>
<p>The <a href="https://gitter.im/lagom/lagom">Lagom Gitter room</a> and <a href="https://gitter.im/lagom/contributors">Lagom contributors Gitter room</a> will remain as real-time chat channels, but we suggest posting questions in discuss.lagomframework.com if you don&rsquo;t get a quick response. With the Lagom community and maintainer team distributed around the world, not everyone can take part in a conversation on Gitter at the same time. With Gitter&rsquo;s linear and conversational format, it can be hard to keep track of concurrent discussions, and it&rsquo;s easy to miss messages. The new forum will make it much easier to keep track of the conversations you are interested in, and ignore the ones you aren&rsquo;t. Asynchronous communication is not just for microservices!</p>
<h2><a href="#what-other-community-channels-are-there-" name="what-other-community-channels-are-there-">What other community channels are there?</a></h2>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/lagom">Stack Overflow</a> is still a great place to ask specific programming questions about Lagom, especially when they also relate to other technologies that are not part of discuss.lightbend.com. Stack Overflow has a huge community, and the Lagom maintainer team continues to monitor the &ldquo;lagom&rdquo; tag on it. However, Stack Overflow has a strict Q&amp;A format and <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/help/on-topic">rules about what is considered on-topic</a>. It is not suitable for opinion-based questions, announcements, or open-ended discussion.</li>
  <li>Of course, <a href="https://github.com/lagom/lagom">GitHub</a> is the center for collaboration on development of Lagom itself, and the <a href="https://github.com/lagom/lagom/issues">issue tracker</a> is the best place to report reproducible bugs and propose new features. If you&rsquo;re having a problem and you&rsquo;re not sure if it&rsquo;s caused by a bug in Lagom, please ask for help on discuss.lagomframework.com before creating an issue on GitHub.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a href="#what-if-i-want-urgent-24-7-support-" name="what-if-i-want-urgent-24-7-support-">What if I want urgent 24/7 support?</a></h2>
<p>Nothing changes in this aspect. The public communication channels were always best-effort, although we and the community do try to help as much as possible. If you really want the best-in-class, most responsive answers and support, the <a href="https://www.lightbend.com/subscription">Lightbend Subscription</a> offers professional development and production support, along with access to consulting services, training, the <a href="https://www.lightbend.com/products/enterprise-suite">Lightbend Enterprise Suite</a> of commercial software, and other benefits.</p>
<p>It is important to highlight that the move to the &ldquo;discuss&rdquo; forum (as we like to call it) is not the same as commercial support, however we do hope to serve our communities better by making this move. We do not envision any negative impact on the quality of the answers you have been receiving on Gitter and lagom-framework by this move to the new forums.</p>
<p>We hope you&rsquo;re as excited about the new discussion forums as we are. We look forward to you joining us there!</p>]]></content>

          <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Lagom is an OSS framework to build microservice-based software systems. At Lightbend we sponsor the development of the framework and encourage contributions from the community, but we also help people get started, be more productive when using it or solve the bugs there may be in the framework code. We participate on the <a href="https://discuss.lagomframework.com">Discuss Lagom Forum</a>, <a href="https://gitter.im/lagom/lagom">Gitter</a> channel and, of course, <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/lagom">Stack Overflow</a> and <a href="https://github.com/lagom/lagom/issues">GitHub issues</a>, but Lightbend also provides support for its <a href="https://www.lightbend.com/subscription">subscribers</a> using Lagom. We sometimes detect the same questions pop up repeatedly on those channels of support. In order to reduce repeating the same answers over and over and because common problems should have readily available solutions, we created the <a href="https://github.com/lagom/lagom-recipes">Lagom Recipes</a> repository.</p>
<h3><a href="#lagom-recipes" name="lagom-recipes">Lagom Recipes</a></h3>
<p>Like a cookbook, the Lagom recipes repository contains a varied list of step-by-step solutions to common problems Lagom developers may face. Take for example the common request on the Mailing List: &ldquo;How do I enable CORS for my Lagom API?&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s a simple enough request but in Lagom the solution is slightly different whether you are using the <code>javadsl</code> or the <code>scaladsl</code> so the common response to such a question was &ldquo;Are you using java or scala?&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s a problem which involves some knowledge of <a href="https://www.playframework.com/">Play</a> which is a building block of Lagom. Therefore the explanation ends up being a bit confusing. It is easier to prepare two recipes to answer the question for Java or Scala developers in mind and explain each step on the README.</p>
<p>Every recipe may contain a README file detailing the what files would you need to add or edit in order to complete the recipe. On top of that, recipes are not meant to start a project from scratch. Instead, each recipe details the necessary increment over an existing Lagom Service or a complete Lagom system of many services. The recipe is usually developed in few separate commits to demonstrate the increment necessary to complete your goal:</p>
<ul>
  <li>a first commit sets up the minimum Lagom system</li>
  <li>a second commit introduces the changes necessary to complete the task and the README file explaining the changes.</li>
</ul>
<p>The current list of recipes includes solutions for problems such as:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/lagom/lagom-recipes/tree/master/cors">How do I enable CORS</a>?</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/lagom/lagom-recipes/tree/master/consumer-service">How do I create a Subscriber only service</a>?</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/lagom/lagom-recipes/tree/master/mixed-persistence">How do I use RDBMS read-sides with Cassandra write-sides</a>?</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/lagom/lagom-recipes/tree/master/i18n">How do I create a stateless service in Lagom for Java that uses Play&rsquo;s Internationalization Support</a>?</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/lagom/lagom-recipes/tree/master/http-header-handling">How do I manipulate Headers and Status Codes and test those cases</a>?</li>
</ul>
<p>We hope adding this learning resource to the list of <a href="https://www.lagomframework.com/documentation/">documentation resources</a> already available will help create great applications!</p>]]></content>

<p>Contrary to the previous milestone releases, a RC is production ready. We are now entering the release candidate phase (typically 4 weeks) in which only major bugs (if any) will be fixed. </p>
<h3><a href="#migrating-from-other-versions" name="migrating-from-other-versions">Migrating from other versions</a></h3>
<ul>

          <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We are very pleased to announce the availability of the third milestone release of Lagom 1.4.0. Although we had originally hoped to have a release candidate available by now, there are still a few <a href="https://github.com/lagom/lagom/milestone/25">known issues</a> with the 1.4.0 release that will take a little time to complete. In the meantime, there are enough changes since M2 that we decided to publish a new milestone to allow users on the bleeding edge to give them a try. Thanks for your patience!</p>
<p>Please note that we still do not recommend using a milestone release in production, as there may still be incompatible changes up until the first release candidate.</p>

<ul>
  <li>If you are migrating into Lagom 1.4.0-M3 from 1.4.0-M2 you should have a look at the release announcements for Lagom versions <a href="https://www.lagomframework.com/blog/lagom-1-3-9.html">1.3.9</a> and <a href="https://www.lagomframework.com/blog/lagom-1-3-10.html">1.3.10</a>.

</ul>
<h3><a href="#improvements" name="improvements">Improvements</a></h3>
<ul>
  <li>The Lagom circuit breaker can be configured to ignore certain exceptions. These exceptions will still be seen by the client, but they will no longer cause the circuit breaker to open. See the documentation on circuit breaker configuration (<a href="https://www.lagomframework.com/documentation/1.4.x/java/ServiceClients.html#Circuit-Breaker-Configuration">Java</a>/<a href="https://www.lagomframework.com/documentation/1.4.x/scala/ServiceClients.html#Circuit-Breaker-Configuration">Scala</a>) and service error handling (<a href="https://www.lagomframework.com/documentation/1.4.x/java/ServiceErrorHandling.html">Java</a>/<a href="https://www.lagomframework.com/documentation/1.4.x/scala/ServiceErrorHandling.html">Scala</a>) for more details.</li>
  <li>You can now <a href="https://github.com/lagom/lagom/pull/1010">disable entity passivation</a> by setting <code>lagom.persistence.passivate-after-idle-timeout = 0</code> in <code>application.conf</code>. This allows your service to keep all entities resident in memory or control passivation more directly.</li>
  <li>The Message Broker API now provides the <code>Subscriber.withMetadata</code> method to allow consumers to access details about each method such as the Kafka message key. See the documentation on consuming message metadata (<a href="https://www.lagomframework.com/documentation/1.4.x/java/MessageBrokerApi.html#Consuming-message-metadata">Java</a>/<a href="https://www.lagomframework.com/documentation/1.4.x/scala/MessageBrokerApi.html#Consuming-message-metadata">Scala</a>) for details.</li>
  <li>The default port for the development mode service locator changed from 8000 to 9008. This is rarely used directly, so it should be transparent for most users, but 8000 is a common port for other services to run on (including the default debug port used by <code>mvnDebug</code>), so this will reduce the chance of conflicts.</li>
  <li>Several underlying dependencies were updated (including Play and Akka)</li>
</ul>

          <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We are very pleased to announce the availability of the second Milestone release of Lagom 1.4.0. This is a preview release of the Lagom 1.4 series, which is focused on upgrading all of its building blocks. This release includes Play 2.6 and Akka 2.5&mdash;like Lagom 1.4.0-M1&mdash;but both have been upgraded to the latest minor release. It also includes the latest Slick 3.2.1 and Kafka 0.11.0.0. We are still adding the finishing touches to support Scala 2.12 in the Lagom 1.4.x series.</p>
<p>Phew, that was a mouthful.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, we&rsquo;ve decided that <a href="https://github.com/lagom/lagom/issues/932">supporting sbt 1.0</a> is not a feature we will work on before releasing Lagom 1.4.0. At the moment it is still undecided if support for sbt 1.0 will come during the 1.4.x series or later.</p>
<h3><a href="#migrating-from-other-versions" name="migrating-from-other-versions">Migrating from other versions</a></h3>
<p>The Lagom 1.4.x series is not focused on providing new, big features. Instead, it provides a collection of small improvements.</p>
<ul>
  <li>If you are migrating into Lagom 1.4.0-M2 from 1.4.0-M1 you should have a look at the release announcements for Lagom versions <a href="https://www.lagomframework.com/blog/lagom-1-3-6.html">1.3.6</a>, <a href="https://www.lagomframework.com/blog/lagom-1-3-7.html">1.3.7</a>, and <a href="https://www.lagomframework.com/blog/lagom-1-3-9.html">1.3.8</a>. The migration guide to 1.4 (<a href="https://www.lagomframework.com/documentation/1.4.x/java/Migration14.html">java</a> or <a href="https://www.lagomframework.com/documentation/1.4.x/scala/Migration14.html">scala</a>) has also been improved, don&rsquo;t forget to review it.</li>
  <li>If you are migrating into Lagom 1.4.0-M2 from a version in the Lagom 1.3.x series you should have a look at changes introduced in latest versions of the Lagom 1.3.x series and especially you should read the migration guide to 1.4 (<a href="https://www.lagomframework.com/documentation/1.4.x/java/Migration14.html">java</a> or <a href="https://www.lagomframework.com/documentation/1.4.x/scala/Migration14.html">scala</a>).</li>
</ul>
<h3><a href="#improvements" name="improvements">Improvements</a></h3>
<ul>
  <li>The Akka-HTTP based Service Gateway <a href="https://www.lagomframework.com/blog/lagom-1-3-7.html">introduced in Lagom 1.3.7</a> is enabled by default. It is possible to switch back to the old, Netty-based implementation. Please <a href="https://github.com/lagom/lagom/issues/new">raise an issue</a> to let us know if you need to do this. The Netty-based implementation will be removed in a future version of Lagom, but we want to fix any regressions first. Check out the <a href="https://www.lagomframework.com/documentation/1.4.x/java/ServiceLocator.html#Default-gateway-implementation">docs</a> for more details.</li>
  <li>Service Locators may return many URIs. If you have implemented your own Service Locator you may override the new <code>locateAll</code> methods so that a request for a service location returns not just one URI, but many. This was specifically included to connect to clustered services where the service SDK expects a collection of hosts and deals with the balancing internally (e.g. Cassandra or Kafka).</li>
  <li>A new <a href="https://github.com/lagom/lagom/issues/841"><code>CircuitBreakersPanel</code></a> replaces the previously internal, now deprecated <code>CircuitBreakers</code>. This change is especially relevant for Service Locator implementors so they have access to the underlying API. A <code>CircuitBreakersPanel</code> instance holds all the Circuit Breakers for the current instance to connect to all the remote services.</li>
</ul>

<p>This release includes great contributions from the community. Thanks Wayne Wang, Elijah Rippeth, Yuliana Apaza and Surya Prakash Singh. Special thanks if this was your <a href="https://www.lagomframework.com/get-involved.html">first contribution</a>.</p>]]></content>

<p>This release fixes <a href="https://github.com/lagom/lagom/issues/974">a deadlock</a> when shutting down a Lagom process in some scenarios and brings Scala DSL Json Serialization feature-parity by providing an opt-in <a href="https://github.com/lagom/lagom/issues/955">compressor</a> for serialized messages. We also <a href="https://github.com/lagom/lagom/issues/968">upgraded</a> the underlying logback library.</p>
<p>This release is no different than previous ones and we continue to have great community contributions. Thanks to GitHub users <a href="https://github.com/t-h-a-l-i-s">t-h-a-l-i-s</a> and <a href="https://github.com/jiminhsieh">Jimin Hsieh</a>.</p>
<h2><a href="#json-serialization-compression" name="json-serialization-compression">Json Serialization compression</a></h2>
<p>Compression, as described here, is only used for persistent events, persistent snapshots and remote messages within the service cluster. It is not used for messages that are serialized in the external API of the service.</p>
<p>JSON can be rather verbose and for large messages it can be beneficial to enable compression. That is done by using the <code>JsonSerializer.compressed[T]</code> builder method instead of the <code>JsonSerializer.apply[T]</code>:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint"><code>import com.lightbend.lagom.scaladsl.playjson.{JsonSerializer, JsonSerializerRegistry}

object RegistryWithCompression extends JsonSerializerRegistry {
  override val serializers = Vector(

    // &#39;AddComment&#39; uses `apply[T]()` .
    JsonSerializer[AddComment],

    // The AddPost message is usually rather big, so we want it compressed
    // when it&#39;s too large.
    JsonSerializer.compressed[AddPost]

  )
}
</code></pre>
<p>The serializer will by default only compress messages that are larger than 1024 bytes. This threshold can be changed with configuration property:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint"><code>lagom.serialization.json {

  # The serializer will compress the payload if the message class
  # was registered using JsonSerializer.compressed and the payload
  # is larger than this value. Only used for remote messages within
  # the cluster of the service.
  compress-larger-than = 1024b

}
</code></pre>]]></content>
